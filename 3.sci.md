# Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)

## Asim’s Notes

- Introduction
    - What is the SCI.
    - Walk through the equation and key aspects of each variable.
    - Clearly mention no credits are allowed.
    - What are the future more domain specific versions of SCI in the pipeline.
    - Until then it’s up to you to figure out how to define a SCI calculation.
    - The goal is transparency, esp. with the core SCI since there are so many assumptions you can make.
    - IMP enables that transparency.
- Process of calculating an SCI score
- Decide what to include in your Software Boundary
    - Talk through the idea of the software boundary.
    - How this translates to components and grouping nodes in IF.
    - Show from the example IMP.
    - How there is lots of variability here, it’s incredibly important to be transparent and clear with your IF file so people know what you are talking about.
- Choose your Functional Unit
    - Talk through the FU
- Decide your methodology
    - Talk through the two broad solutions, measurement and calculation.
    - This translates to the pipeline, what observations can you gather about your running system and the pipeline of plugins you will need to convert that not only to a carbon value but also to a functional unit.
- Quantify
    - Execute your manifest file and extract the outputs.
    - Share the file itself, not the end numbers.
    - So anyone else out there can take what you have done, and replicate.
- Models
    - What models do we have that can help you specifically in creating a SCI score.
- Example
    - Complete an almost finished manifest file which computes carbon, but make it compute SCI instead by adding the SCI module and configuring it.

The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) technical specification **describes how to calculate the carbon intensity of a software application**. It describes the methodology of calculating the total carbon emissions and the selection criteria to turn the total into a rate that can be used to achieve real-world, physical emissions reductions.

Version 1.1.0 of the specification was published in April 2024:

# SCI Guidance

---

The SCI Guidance project details various approaches on how to understand the different methodologies that are available for calculating energy, carbon intensity, embodied emissions and functional unit values which are the core components of the SCI calculation:

# ISO Standard

The SCI was first published as an ISO Standard in March 2024. You can purchase it here:

[ISO/IEC 21031:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/86612.html)

# For Joseph & Asim

---

- Standard aiming at addressing issues of inflexibility, low time resolution, software specificity, agility for software carbon
- Applies to all software
- Unopinionated about precise calculations done to yield E, I, M, R -> flexible and widely applicable
- Critically rejects market based emissions so reducing SCi can only happen by emitting less carbon
- Equation
- Trade-offs
    - Spec applies to highest level equation but route to E, I, M and R is unspecified, meaning there is a knowledge barrier and scope to mislead
    - Enables like-for-like comparisons assuming two instances use identical R
    - Challenges with sharing best practices and accepted pipelines
- Implies a need for transparent, reproducible calculations
- The software boundary is an important aspect of the SCI, being clear about what you are measuring since we expect without that clarify people will “game” their scores over time by just tweaking the boundary. GHG also talks about the “boundary” of an organization vs. another organization and how that defines what goes into a GHG calculation, the SCI wanted a boundary that would break across organizations”.
