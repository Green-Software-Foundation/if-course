# Quickstart

Impact Framework is an open source tool for measuring the environmental impacts of software applications. At its core, it processes IMP files—YAML files that describe your system’s architecture, the operations to execute, and the observational data to process. In this chapter, you’ll both learn how to work with the framework hands‑on and gain a conceptual understanding of its components.

The quickstart not only helps you get hands‑on immediately but also reinforces that an IMP file is both executable and auditable. You can always trace back your computed outputs to the exact configuration and input data used.


## Install Impact Framework

Before you begin, ensure that you have Nodejs installed on your machine. Then install Impact Framework globally with the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @grnsft/if
```

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
if-run --help
```

You should see a help screen similar to this:

```bash
Impact Framework

Options

  -m, --manifest string   [path to the input file]
  -o, --output string     [path to the output file]
  -n, --no-output         [prevent output to the console]
  -h, --help              [prints out the above help instruction]
  -a, --append            [append to outputs, instead of overwriting]
  -d, --debug             [prints out debug logs to the console]
  --observe               [executes only observe pipeline of the manifest]
  --regroup               [executes only regroup pipeline of the manifest]
  --compute               [executes only compute pipeline of the manifest]

> [!NOTE]
> This CLI interface is the gateway to running your IMP files. The `if-run` command takes your manifest file, processes it according to the configuration in its context, and outputs enriched data that can be used for further analysis or visualization.

## Setup your workspace

Organize your work by creating a new folder on your machine.

1. On your computer create a folder called `my-first-imp`
2. Download this a sample manifest file #TODO which contains everything needed to compute the environmental impacts of a hypothetical website, (the GSF website) and save it as `web.yml` inside `my-first-imp`

## Run Impact Framework

Open your terminal in `my-first-imp` and execute:

```bash
if-run --manifest web.yml
```

This runs the manifest and prints new YAML data to the console.

```bash
TODO - What does it print?
```

Congratulations you've computed the environmental impacts of the green software foundation website. It's a bit hard to parse the output to glean useful data, such as how much actual carbon we emitted, so first let's output to a file and then use our visualizer to view the results.

Let's re-run the command but output to a file instead of the console.

```bash
if-run --manifest web.yml --output web.out.yml
```

> [!TIP]
> To save are few characters you can type `if-run -m web.yml -o web.out.yml`

Now if you open up the file `web.out.yml` and search for TODO then you will see something like so:

```yaml
TODO - The section which shows the carbon
```

This is the carbon emissions of our website for the month TODO. But this is quite hard to parse, so let's instead load up the file in our vizualiser.

## View in the Visualizer

The vizualizer is a web application that parses the contents of an IMP file and presents the data whitin in a much more user friendly manner.

Make sure you are in the folder where the `web.out.yml` live and type:

```bash
if-viz --manifest web.out.yml
```

This will do three things, it will:

1. It will serve the file `web.out.yml` from your local computer so it can be accesses as `localhost:8080/web.out.yml`
1. It will then open up the default browser on your computer pointed to `https://viz.if.greensoftware.foundation` and load `localhost:8080/web.out.yml`
1. Finally, any time now you update web.out.yml, it will refresh the browser so you vizualize the latest version of the IMP file.

We will dive into the vizualizer in more detail later, but for now there are a few key places for you to see.

At the top you will see the carbon emissons and the SCI score for this example manifest, if you want to toggle between the two just click carbon or SCI.

> [!TIP]
> These are the aggregated values, whatever values you configure to aggregate in a manifest file, will be presented in the visualizer at the top. You can find more information about aggregation in the aggregate section of the course.

TODO - IMAGE

Underneath you will find the component pie chart. This pie chart shows how the different components of the computation contribute to the total that you have sleected (either carbon, or sci in this example).

> [!TIP]
> The computation of an impact in IF is does through a tree structure. The total carbon computed is the sum of the carbon for a series of components grouped into nodes. The root node of the tree contains the total carbon emissions, but the tree is a tree of emissions, you can click into each node and see how sub-componeents contributed to the total emissions.

Underneath the pie chart is the table. This is a tabular representation of the tree in the IMP file. Each row in the table is a node in the tree. The child nodes (components) are the rows which have no children, these are the sources of impacts. The rows with children are just the aggregate values of the components.

TODO - IMAGE

> [!TIP]
> A component is something that has impacts, it can be a CPU, a server, a user, anything you want. Conceptually a component is just something that has impacts. In terms of the tree, a component is only at the leaves of the tree.
> A grouping is a set of components or other groupings, they form higher level nodes int he tree and are usefull ways to group components and their impacts together, for instance you might create a tree where each component is a server, and the servers are grouped into "regions". The region for west-uk is considered a grouping. 
> In the table, rows which have children are grouping nodes and rows without children are coponent nodes in the tree.

When you click on a component (either in the table or in the pie chart) a fly-out side panel will appear, like so:

TODO - IMAGE

The side panel shows a the data and methodology which was used to calculate the impact, in this case carbon.

In the example above, we see the flyout has 3 sections.

- defaults: These are default values which are repeated acrsoss all observations (useful if you have multuole observations)
- inputs: These are the input observations, the data you are feeding into the calculation of the impacts.
- pipeline: This is a representation of the methodology used to comppute the impacts, you can dive into the deails in the IMP file itself.
- outputs: These are the output impacts, the result of passing the inputs into the pipeline, carbon as you can see is an output in this case.

We will explore more regarding these concepts in the next module.


## Change Assumptions

One of the most powerful aspects of IF and IMP files, is they are executable. 

They contain not just the outputs, not just the aggregated impact values, but all the inputs, observations all the data and methdologies required to re-compute the impact with perhaps different data and different methodologies.

Here we will change a key assumpion in our manifest file and recompute the impact.

Open up the web.yml in your favourite code editor and fine the line:

TODO

and replace with the line

TODO

THis change represent XYZ, perhaps you hold different assumpptions, perhaps you want to explore different scenarios and run what-if experiments or perhaps you just want to execute a manifst file to verify the outputs are infact accurate.

Now you can simply re-run the manifest file like before

```bash
if-run --manifest web.yml --output web.out.yml
```

The vizualser should update automatically if you are using if-viz, if not refresh the browser.

The aggregated carbon figure is now TODO instead of TODO.

If you dive into the table and expand the row TODO, and then click the <> the fly out will appear, there you will see that your value for TODO is present in the inputs and that a new value of TODO is visible in the outputs.
