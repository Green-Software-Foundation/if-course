# Essential Concepts

## Summary

The Impact Framework (IF) is an **open-source tool** designed to **calculate and share the environmental impacts of software**. It aims to make the measurement of impacts like carbon emissions, water usage, and energy consumption more accessible and transparent. IF operates through **Impact Manifest Protocol (IMP) files**, which are central to its functionality. For more information, see the **Welcome to Impact Framework** page at [https://if.greensoftware.foundation/](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/).

## Design Philosophy

The development and evolution of the Impact Framework are guided by a set of core **design philosophies** that underpin its functionality, usability, and community engagement. These principles ensure that IF remains a robust, transparent, and valuable tool for measuring and mitigating software's environmental impact. The key tenets of this design philosophy include:

### Transparency 

This principle emphasizes the importance of making the entire environmental impact calculation process open and understandable. The **manifest file** is central to this, as it explicitly **defines all the context for a calculation**, including the application's architecture, the observation period, the pipeline of calculations, and the environmental impacts being tracked. 

### Verifiability

Verifiability ensures that impact calculations can be independently checked and confirmed. Because **everything needed to perform a calculation is contained within the manifest file**, anyone with the manifest can **re-execute it and verify the reported impact values**. 

### Flexibility

Impact Framework imposes **minimum of constraints** on its users, balancing standards that ensure plugin interoperability with the freedom for expression and creativity in defining and measuring impacts. 

### Modularity

IF is designed as a **minimal set of core features** that enable the processing of manifest files. It provides a tool for processing manifests and a set of standards, allowing developers to create **plugins that perform specific tasks**, such as data retrieval from particular providers or applying specific calculations.

### Neutrality

Impact Framework strives to support **maximally decentralised plugin development**. It aims to empower anyone to build and use plugins for calculating their environmental impacts without gatekeeping what can be measured. The focus is on providing the minimal **protocol** required to support community plugin development and ensure a degree of safety and consistency in calculations. The goal is to see an organic and permissionless growth of the Impact Framework plugin ecosystem.

These principles are further explained in the [Design philosophy](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/docs/design-philosophy) documentation.


## Impacts

**Impacts** on the other hand, are the **environmental consequences** that are calculated from these raw observations. These are the metrics that Impact Framework ultimately aims to quantify, such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, or even broader indicators like a Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) score.

## Observations

These are the raw data points that are collected about the software application. 

Observations can take many forms, including **direct measurements** like power consumption or network data transfer, as well as **proxy metrics** such as CPU utilisation, memory usage, or even higher-level application metrics like the number of requests served or page views.

## Plugins

The transition from raw observations to meaningful impact metrics is facilitated by the use of **plugins** and their sequential execution within **pipelines**. 

**Plugins** are the **fundamental building blocks** of the Impact Framework—they're self-contained units of code designed to perform a single, specific task.

Plugins can perform various functions, such as **observing usage metrics**, **retrieving data from files or APIs**, or **executing transformations and calculations** on input data. For example, a common plugin might take CPU utilization data as input and estimate energy consumption.

The Impact Framework includes a **standard library of built-in plugins**, developed and maintained by the IF core team, covering common operations like arithmetic calculations, file input/output, and data manipulation. 

Additionally there is a strong ecosystem of **community-developed plugins**. [**IF Explorer website**](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/) serves as a central repository where users can browse, use, and contribute plugins.

## Models

TODO - A model is an instance of a plugin, configured with different parameters and for different use cases.

EXAMPLE YAML - Coefficient. Two cases.

## Pipelines

A **pipeline** is a **sequence of plugins** executed in order to transform **observations** into meaningful **impacts**. Data flows sequentially through the pipeline, with each plugin performing a specific operation—adding or updating information along the way. This transformation process, from raw observation data to calculated impacts, is known as **induction**.



Each individual plugin performs a single, focused task. While plugins themselves remain simple, together they **act like Legos**, combining into sophisticated workflows where the output from one plugin becomes input for the next.  

This modularity is a key design principle, enabling complex impact assessments by chaining together individual plugins.

Ultimately, the pipeline represents the **methodology** used to compute impacts. By explicitly embedding this methodology within your manifest file, you ensure transparency, auditability, and verifiability—allowing others to clearly see, execute, and validate your calculations.

## Components

A **component** represents a distinct part of your software system that contributes to environmental impacts, such as servers, laptops, devices, networks, or bandwidth. Essentially, anything within your system associated with environmental impact is modeled as a component in an IMP file.

Each component is defined by:

- A set of **observations** gathered about its behavior.
- The specific **impacts** you aim to measure.
- A **pipeline** (methodology) used to convert these observations into measurable impacts.

Components can also be organized under parent **groupings**. These hierarchical groupings help you identify which parts of your technology stack contribute most significantly to emissions.

By structuring your components in the IMP file, you enable both detailed analysis of individual system parts and aggregated insights into larger sections of your application. This approach allows you to understand precisely how each component contributes to your software's overall environmental footprint.

## Impact Manifest Protocol (IMP) Files

**IMP files** (also referred to as **manifest files**) are written in **YAML format** and serve as executable audits for environmental impact calculations. They include all necessary configurations, define the observations, impacts, plugins, pipelines, grouping and componetns about your system.

IMP files are **shareable**, **portable**, and **human-readable**, enabling verifiable and auditable calculations. Structurally, a manifest file consists of two main sections:

- **context**: Defines the overall environment and parameters.
- **tree**: Specifies the sequence and dependencies of operations.

In short, the **IMP files are where the magic happens**.

For more information, refer to the [Manifest File documentation](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/docs/manifest-file).
