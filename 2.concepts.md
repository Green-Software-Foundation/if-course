# Essential Concepts

## Summary

The Impact Framework (IF) is an **open-source tool** designed to **calculate and share the environmental impacts of software**. It aims to make measuring impacts like carbon emissions, water usage, and energy consumption more accessible and transparent. IF operates through **Impact Manifest Protocol (IMP) files**, which are central to its functionality. For more information, see the [Impact Framework Website](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/).

## Design Philosophy

The development and evolution of the Impact Framework are guided by a set of core **design philosophies**:

### Transparency 

This principle emphasizes the importance of making the entire environmental impact calculation process open and understandable. The **manifest file** is central to this, as it explicitly **defines all the context for a calculation**, including the application's architecture, the observation period, the calculation methodology, and the tracked environmental impacts. 

### Verifiability

Verifiability ensures that impact calculations can be independently checked and confirmed. Because **everything needed to perform a calculation is contained within the manifest file**, anyone with the manifest can **re-execute it and verify the reported impact values**. 

### Flexibility

Impact Framework imposes **minimum of constraints** on its users, balancing standards that ensure plugin interoperability with the freedom for expression and creativity in defining and measuring impacts. 

### Modularity

Impact Framework is designed with a **minimal set of core features** that enable the processing of manifest files. It provides a tool for processing manifests and a set of standards, allowing developers to create **plugins that perform specific tasks**, such as data retrieval from particular providers or applying specific calculations.

### Neutrality

Impact Framework strives to support **maximally decentralized plugin development**. It aims to empower anyone to build and use plugins to calculate their environmental impacts without gatekeeping what can be measured. The focus is on providing the minimal **protocol** required to support community plugin development and ensure a degree of safety and consistency in calculations. The goal is to see organic and permissionless growth in the Impact Framework plugin ecosystem.

These principles are further explained in the [Design philosophy](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/docs/design-philosophy) documentation.

## Observations

These are the raw data points collected about a component in a software application. Observations can take many forms, including **direct measurements** like power consumption or network data transfer, and **proxy metrics** such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or even higher-level application metrics like the number of requests served or page views. 

Observations are data you can access or gather about your application.

## Impacts

**Impacts**, on the other hand, are the **environmental consequences** calculated from these raw observations. These are the metrics that Impact Framework ultimately aims to quantify, such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, or even broader indicators like a Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) score. 

## Plugins

The transition from **observations** to **impacts** is facilitated using **plugins** and their sequential execution within **pipelines**. 

**Plugins** are the **fundamental building blocks** of the Impact Framework. They're self-contained units of code designed to perform a single, specific task.

Plugins can perform various functions, such as **retrieving data from files or APIs**, or **executing transformations and calculations** on input observations. For example, a common plugin might take CPU utilization data as input and estimate energy consumption.

The Impact Framework includes a [standard library of built-in plugins](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/reference/plugins), developed and maintained by the IF core team, covering everyday operations like arithmetic calculations, file input/output, and data manipulation. 

Additionally, a strong ecosystem of [community-developed plugins](https://explorer.if.greensoftware.foundation/) is a central repository where users can browse, use, and contribute to plugins.

## Models

A **model** is an instance of a plugin, configured with different parameters and for different use cases, a model has a name and can be referenced in a pipeline.

## Pipelines

A **pipeline** is a **sequence of models** executed in order to transform **observations** into meaningful **impacts**. Data flows sequentially through the pipeline, with each model plugin performing a specific operation, adding or updating information along the way. This transformation process, from raw observation data to calculated impacts, is known as **induction**.

Each individual plugin performs a single, focused task. While plugins remain simple, they **act like Legos**, combining into sophisticated workflows where the output from one plugin becomes input for the next.  

This modularity is a key design principle, enabling complex impact assessments by chaining together individual plugins.

Ultimately, the pipeline represents the **methodology** used to compute impacts. By explicitly embedding this methodology within your manifest file, you ensure transparency, auditability, and verifiability—allowing others to clearly see, execute, and validate your calculations.

## Components & Groupings

A **component** represents a distinct part of your software system that contributes to environmental impacts, such as servers, laptops, devices, networks, or bandwidth. Essentially, anything associated with environmental impact within your system is modelled as a component.

Each component is defined by:
- A set of **observations** gathered about its behavior.
- The specific **impacts** you aim to measure.
- A **pipeline** (methodology) used to convert these observations into measurable impacts.

Components can also be organized under parent **groupings**. These hierarchical groupings help you identify which parts of your technology stack contribute most to emissions.

By structuring your components under groupings, you enable detailed analysis of individual system parts and aggregated insights into larger sections of your application. This approach allows you to understand precisely how each component contributes to your software's overall environmental footprint.

## Impact Manifest Protocol (IMP) Files

**IMP files** (also referred to as **manifest files**) are written in **YAML format** and serve as the core file format for Impact Framework. They are executable audits for environmental impact calculations. They include all necessary configurations and define your system's observations, impacts, plugins, pipelines, grouping and components.

IMP files are **shareable**, **portable**, and **human-readable**, enabling verifiable and auditable calculations. Structurally, a manifest file consists of two main sections:

- **context**: Defines the overall environment and parameters.
- **tree**: Specifies the sequence and dependencies of operations.

In short, the **IMP files are where the magic happens**.

For more information, refer to the [Manifest File documentation](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/docs/manifest-file).

A skeleton manifest file looks something like so:

```yaml
name: My First Manifest File
initialize: 
  plugins:                  # <1>
    my-model-plugin:        # <2>
      method: PluginName    # <3>
      path: path.to.plugin  # <3>
tree:               
  children:         
    my-component:           # <4>
      pipeline:           
        compute:      
 - my-model-plugin # <5>
      inputs:               # <6>    
 - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cpu-utilization: 23      
      outputs: ~            # <7>
 - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cpu-utilization: 23      
          energy: 1.2      
```
1. This is where we configure all the model plugins in the manifest file
2. This is an instance of a plugin we named `my-model-plugin`.
3. This is the name and path to the plugin's location in your local filesystem.
4. This component is named `my-component`; they can be named however you wish.
5. This is where we configure the pipeline of model plugins; in this example, we have one model called `my-model-plugin`.
6. The inputs are where you can configure any static observations about your application, e.g. `cpu-utilization`.
7. The outputs contain a mixture of the impacts (such as `energy`) and the observations copied from the inputs.

## Investigation

We use the term investigation to describe the process of developing a manifest file. It's not just writing YAML — it involves gathering observations, choosing your target impact metrics, and selecting the correct methodology to induce your observations into impacts. It's a deeper, more analytical process than it might first appear.

## Summary

In this module, we learnt some core essential concepts in Impact Framework. Understanding these terms is crucial as we will be using them extensivly throughout the rest of the course.

Next, we'll explore more broadly how to plan and execute an investigation and introduce you to a core process called IDOMI.
