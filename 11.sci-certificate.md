# SCI Certificate of Disclosure

## Introduction

Throughout this course, you've learned how to use Impact Framework to calculate the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) of software applications. But what comes after you've completed your calculation? How do you share your findings with the world in a credible, transparent way?

The **SCI Certificate of Disclosure** is a voluntary program run by the Green Software Foundation (GSF) that allows organizations to publicly disclose their SCI calculations in a standardized format that anyone can verify using their own copy of Impact Framework. This module will guide you through preparing an Impact Framework investigation specifically for SCI certificate submission.

## What is an SCI Certificate of Disclosure?

An SCI Certificate of Disclosure is **not** a judgment about whether your software is "green" or environmentally friendly. Instead, it certifies that you have:

1. **Calculated an SCI score** using transparent methodologies
2. **Disclosed your calculation** in a structured, reviewable format
3. **Committed to transparency** by sharing your input data and methodology choices
4. **Agreed to engage** with peer community feedback

Think of it as a badge of *methodological transparency* rather than an achievement award. It signals to the world that you're willing to openly share how you calculated your software's environmental impact, while many competitors remain opaque.

### Why Pursue an SCI Certificate?

**Supply Chain Transparency**: As more software providers disclose their SCI scores, downstream organizations can use real supplier data instead of estimates when calculating their own environmental impacts.

**Procurement Advantage**: Many enterprise buyers now require sustainability data as part of their procurement processes. An SCI certificate demonstrates your commitment to transparency.

**Academic Contribution**: Your disclosed data becomes part of a research database that helps improve software sustainability methodologies for everyone.

**Competitive Differentiation**: Stand out by demonstrating transparency while competitors make unverifiable environmental claims.

## The Role of Impact Framework

The Impact Framework is the **required tool** for SCI certificate submissions. Specifically, you must submit your calculation as an **IMP file** (Impact Manifest Protocol file) - the YAML manifest format you've been learning throughout this course.

Why IMP files?

- **Executable**: Your manifest can be run by others using `if-run` to verify calculations
- **Transparent**: All methodologies, plugins, and coefficients are visible
- **Standardized**: Structured format enables automated validation
- **Comprehensive**: Captures input data, intermediate calculations, and final outputs

Everything you've learned about writing manifest files in this course directly prepares you for SCI certificate submission.

## Preparing Your Investigation for Certificate Submission

### Step 1: Complete Your Training

Before you can submit an SCI certificate, you should complete:

- **SCI Training**: Understanding the SCI specification (covered in Module 5)
- **Impact Framework Training**: This course you're taking right now!

Upon completion, you'll gain access to the GSF peer community forums where you can discuss your methodology choices before submission.

### Step 2: Follow IDOMI Methodology

As you learned in Module 6a, the IDOMI methodology is the recommended approach for SCI investigations:

1. **Impacts**: Define your target SCI score (e.g., "carbon per API request")
2. **Dependencies**: Build your impact dependency tree showing what you need to calculate
3. **Observations**: Identify what data you can actually measure or gather
4. **Methodology**: Select appropriate plugins and approaches for transforming observations into impacts
5. **Implementation**: Write your IMP manifest file

For certificate submissions, pay special attention to documenting your **rationale** for each methodology choice. The peer community will want to understand why you chose particular approaches.

### Step 3: Ensure Completeness

Your IMP file must include all components needed for someone else to understand and verify your calculation:

#### Software Boundary

Define your software boundary clearly in the manifest metadata:

```yaml
name: my-web-application-sci
description: SCI calculation for MyApp web service covering frontend and backend components
tags:
  boundary: "Frontend web server, Backend API, PostgreSQL database"
  functional-unit: "per API request"
  time-period: "January 2024"
```

#### Complete Data Pipeline

Your manifest should show the full calculation pipeline from raw observations to final SCI score. For example:

```yaml
tree:
  children:
    frontend:
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - memory-utilization-to-energy
          - cpu-utilization-to-energy
          - sum-operational-energy
          - calculate-operational-carbon
          - calculate-embodied-carbon
          - calculate-sci
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2024-01-01T00:00
          duration: 3600
          # ... your observation data ...
```

#### Transparent Coefficients

Any coefficient you use should be documented with its source:

```yaml
memory-energy-coefficient:
  method: Coefficient
  path: "builtin"
  config:
    input-parameter: memory-utilization
    coefficient: 0.00039  # Source: Cloud Carbon Footprint model
    output-parameter: memory-energy
```

Add comments or use the `description` field in your manifest to explain where coefficients come from.

#### Input Data Sources

For each observation, consider adding metadata about how it was gathered:

```yaml
inputs:
  - timestamp: 2024-01-01T00:00
    duration: 3600
    cpu-utilization: 45  # Source: AWS CloudWatch metrics
    memory-utilization: 8.2  # Source: AWS CloudWatch metrics
    requests: 12500  # Source: Application logs
    cloud-region: us-east-1  # Source: AWS account configuration
    cloud-instance: t3.medium
```

### Step 4: Document Your Methodology Choices

The certificate submission includes a questionnaire where you'll explain your methodology decisions. As you build your manifest, keep notes on:

**Why did you choose specific plugins?**
- "Used Teads CPU model because we lack processor-specific power curves"
- "Used WattTime plugin for real-time carbon intensity data instead of annual averages"

**What assumptions did you make?**
- "Assumed uniform traffic distribution across 24-hour period"
- "Used Azure instance metadata for embodied carbon estimation"

**What data sources did you use?**
- "Operational data from Azure Monitor metrics"
- "Carbon intensity from WattTime API"
- "Embodied carbon from Cloud Carbon Footprint model"

**What did you exclude from your boundary?**
- "End-user devices not included in software boundary"
- "Third-party CDN not included due to lack of access to their metrics"

### Step 5: Validate Your Manifest

Before submission, ensure your manifest:

1. **Executes successfully**: Run `if-run -m your-manifest.yml` without errors
2. **Produces outputs**: Verify all expected impacts are calculated
3. **Follows SCI equation**: Confirm your manifest calculates `SCI = (O + M) / R`
4. **Uses appropriate units**: Energy in kWh, carbon in gCO2e, etc.

Common validation issues to check:

```bash
# Test your manifest executes
if-run -m your-manifest.yml -o output.yml

# Check the output contains required values
grep "sci:" output.yml
grep "operational-carbon:" output.yml
grep "embodied-carbon:" output.yml
```

### Step 6: Consider Edge Cases

Your calculation will face peer review. Think about potential questions:

**Temporal Boundaries**:
- Did you calculate SCI for a representative time period?
- If you measured only peak hours, did you document this limitation?

**Component Coverage**:
- Does your manifest cover all significant components of your software?
- Are there components you couldn't measure? Document why.

**Functional Unit**:
- Is your R value meaningful and measurable?
- Can it be used consistently over time?

## The Submission Process

### What You'll Submit

1. **IMP File**: Your complete Impact Framework manifest
2. **Questionnaire**: Detailed form explaining your methodology choices and data sources
3. **Contact Information**: For peer community queries

### What Happens Next

**Automated Validation**: The platform checks your IMP file for:
- Proper YAML syntax
- Required fields present
- Basic SCI specification compliance
- If-run execution success

**Manual Review**: GSF staff confirm:
- Documentation completeness
- Questionnaire adequately filled
- Technical requirements met

**Certificate Publication**: Upon approval:
- Unique URL created (e.g., `certs.greensoftware.foundation/[hash]`)
- Certificate indexed in searchable database
- Your methodology added to the methodology database
- DOI issued for academic citation

**Peer Community Review**: After publication:
- Peer community members can submit queries about your methodology
- You must respond within 14 days
- Constructive dialogue improves the calculation
- Certificate may be updated based on feedback (with version tracking)

## Best Practices for Success

### 1. Start with Reviewed Methodologies

Before creating novel approaches, check the **Methodology Database** for existing, peer-reviewed calculation methods for similar software types. Using established methodologies:
- Speeds up your submission review
- Reduces peer community queries
- Demonstrates alignment with community standards

### 2. Engage Early with Peer Community

Don't wait until submission to get feedback. Post in the peer community forums (available after completing training):
- "I'm measuring a containerized microservices application. What methodology should I use for embodied carbon?"
- "Has anyone used the Boavizta API for embodied carbon estimation?"

### 3. Document Limitations Proactively

Be transparent about what you couldn't measure:

```yaml
name: myapp-sci-calculation
description: |
  SCI calculation for MyApp web service.

  Known limitations:
  - End-user device energy not included (outside software boundary)
  - Third-party API calls estimated using average response times
  - Embodied carbon uses CCF model due to lack of manufacturer data
```

This demonstrates thoughtfulness and prevents peer community members from raising these as issues.

### 4. Use Standard Plugins Where Possible

The Impact Framework `builtin` plugins are well-understood by the peer community:
- `SciEmbodied` for embodied carbon
- `Sci` for final SCI calculation
- `Multiply`, `Sum`, `Divide` for arithmetic
- `CSVLookup` for referencing standard datasets

Custom plugins require more explanation in your questionnaire.

### 5. Version Your Data Sources

If using external datasets (like carbon intensity factors), document versions:

```yaml
carbon-intensity-data:
  method: CSVLookup
  path: builtin
  config:
    filepath: https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-data/releases/download/v0.1.2/grid-intensity.csv
    # Version v0.1.2 published January 2024
```

This allows others to reproduce your calculation.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Insufficient Detail

**Problem**: Manifest has hardcoded values without explanation
```yaml
defaults:
  carbon-intensity: 450  # Where did this come from?
```

**Solution**: Document sources
```yaml
defaults:
  carbon-intensity: 450  # Annual average for AWS us-east-1 from WattTime 2023 data
```

### Incomplete Boundary Definition

**Problem**: Unclear what's included in the calculation
**Solution**: Explicitly state boundary in description and document excluded components

### Missing Intermediate Values

**Problem**: Jumping directly from observations to final SCI without showing intermediate calculations
**Solution**: Include complete pipeline showing energy → carbon → SCI progression

### Inconsistent Functional Units

**Problem**: Using different R values in different parts of the tree
```yaml
frontend:
  inputs:
    - requests: 1000  # per hour?
backend:
  inputs:
    - requests: 50000  # per day?
```

**Solution**: Use consistent units and time periods across all components
