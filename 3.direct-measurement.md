Now we have an understanding of the basics of IF and IMPs, lets walks you through a simple IMP that converts energy consumption into carbon emissions using the built‚Äëin `Coefficient` plugin.

Learning Outcomes:
- Demonstrate the process of **creating a component**, finding some **observations** and turning them into **outputs using plugins**
- Get you comfortable with the process of expressing a calculation in the form of an IMP, running it using Impact Framework and receiving an output file.

## Overview

Imagine you have an **application running in the cloud**. You want to quantify **how much carbon you are emitting by running it**.

## Boilerplate

First off let's create the boilterplate empty imp file which we will continue to work with for the rest of the module.

There are two top-level sections to the IMP, the **context** and the **tree**.

**context** is everything **above** the node called `tree`. This is where you provide all the configuration and metadata for this specific IMP file. This includes loading and configuring the plugins you want to run, this is also where you give the IMP a title and description, like so:

```yaml
name: energy-to-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
```

**tree** is everything under the `tree` key. This is where you organize individual components that represent your system. Each component is just a simple block of YAML with a fixed set of keys. For example, you might have blocks of YAML representing each of several servers, or maybe different parts of your stack such as front-end, back-end, database, storage. What you define as a component is left to you and how you want to structure your IMP file, in our example we are going to model a single server in a data center so we will call our component `server-1` however you can call your components whatever makes the most sense to you.

```yaml
tree:
  children:
    server-1:    # <1>
      defaults:  # <2>
      pipeline:  # <3>
      inputs:    # <4>
```
- <1> This is the name of your component, in our case we will just call this `server-1`. In a real IMP you might name each component more specifically, such as `azure-storage-blob-d23re23d1e7`, etc
- <2> `defaults` are a convenient place to put any values that are common for all inputs in the inputs array. 
- <3> `pipeline` this is where you define which plugins should execute for this component. you have to provide the instance names for the specific plugins you want to execute from the `plugin:initialize` block. This is where you define the *order you* want the plugins to execute in. In longer pipelines, the outputs from one plugin will often be inputs to another, so the order that plugins execute is very important.
- <4> `inputs` is an array of observations. This is the data that the model plugins operate on. Every element in `inputs` has a timestamp and a duration.

So all together our starting IMP file looks like so:

```yaml
name: energy-to-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
tree:
  children:
    server-1:
      defaults:
      pipeline:
      inputs: 
```

Create a file called `single-server.yml` in your workspace and copy and paste the above YAML into it.

## IDOMI

The standard development process for a manifest involves these 5 steps. They don't have to be linear, sometimes they are circular or even recursive. But they are a useful mental model and process for how to develop a manifest file. We will be using it extensively throughout this course.

1. **Impacts**: What impact(s) do you want to compute?
2. **Dependancies**: Start building up an **impact dependancy tree**.
3. **Observations**: What observation(s) can you gather that *could* be induced to an impact via a methodology?
4. **Methodology**: What methodology will you select for inducing the observation(s), into the impact(s)?
5. **Implementation**: Implementation of the methodology as a pipeline of plugins.

The general process starts with **IDO** and ends with **MI**. 

In the example below, the component we want to measure is that of a **server**. 

## Impacts

The **impact** we want to measure is `carbon`.

## Dependancies & Observations 

We start to build up a **impact dependancy tree**, this is a useful tool which can help us figure out what data we need and what methodologies we should be applying. 

The root of our tree is carbon like so

‚òëÔ∏è carbon 

> [!NOTE] 
> The ‚òëÔ∏è is a useful indicator to signal that we still have to implement this.

In this simple example we are lucky enough to be using a cloud provider which already measures and exposes the energy consumption of our server in their monitoring environment. So the **observation** we can gather is `energy`. Let's add this to our impact dependancy tree like so:

‚òëÔ∏è carbon 
- üåø energy

> [!NOTE] 
> An **impact** or an **impact dependancy** is something we need to compute, an **observation** is something we will **use** in a computation. Since energy is an observation it also means it's a leaf in our impact dependancy tree. I like to visually denote an observation with üåø to distinguich between an impact/dependancy.

We will need a **methodology** that **induces** `energy` into `carbon`, there is a well known methodology using the carbon intensity of electricity. Let's add `carbon-intensity` as another observtion we will need to gather in our impact depandancy tree.

‚òëÔ∏è carbon 
- üåø energy
- üåø carbon-intensity

The rest of this module describes how we implement the above process.

## Methodology & Implementation

### `energy`

You look at your cloud provider‚Äôs monitor dashboard and see that it returns energy consumption in kWh for each hour and it currently shows **`0.05 kWh`**.

We need to add an **observation** of energy in our IMP file. We do that by adding an element to the `inputs` property in the `server-1` component like so:

```yaml
tree:
  children:
    server-1:
      defaults:
      pipeline:
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00 # <1>
          duration: 3600 # <2>
          energy: 0.05 # <3> 
```
- <1>. We add the timestamp of the observation.
- <2> The duration of the observation in seconds, here it's 5 minutes.
- <3> The energy in kWh

> [!NOTE]
> There are no standard names of properties or units of properties in IMP. Since each observation property is going to be input into a model plugin, it's important to read the documentation of the model plugin to determine what name of property and unit is expected.

### `carbon-intensity`

We now have added energy to our IMP file, but how do we convert that into carbon? 

This is actually pretty straightforward, because estimates of the carbon emitted per unit of energy used, known as the ‚Äúcarbon intensity‚Äù, are widely available. Grid operators sometimes publish these values, often exposing APIs, and there are also third party providers of this data, such as [WattTime](https://watttime.org/) and [Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map/24h).

If you have energy consumption in kWh and carbon intensity in g CO2e/kWh, their product is **carbon emissions in g CO2e**.

Let‚Äôs say you are in the United Kingdom - you can look up the value for carbon intensity for a specific moment in time from the [National Grid API](https://connecteddata.nationalgrid.co.uk/api-guidance), but in this minimal example you‚Äôll use the annual average, around **`163 gCO2e/kWh`**.

Let's add this to the observations of our server, like so:

```yaml
server-1:
  defaults:
  pipeline:
  inputs:
    - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
      duration: 3600
      energy: 0.05
      # highlight-next-line
      carbon-intensity: 163
```

Multiplying the energy consumption and carbon intensity together yields `8.15 g CO2e`:

```mathematica
0.05 (KWh) * 163 (gCO2e/kWh) = 8.15 gCO2e
```

So in order to convert the enegy in carbon we want a model that let's us multiply the carbon intensity of electricity by the energy, luckily there is a built in plugin called `Multiply` that let's you do this.

TODO - FIX BELOW MESS 

> [!NOTE] Finding model plugins
> You can check the [standard library of ‚Äúbuiltins‚Äù](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/reference/plugins) and find that there is a prebuilt ‚Äú[**Coefficient**](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if/tree/main/src/if-run/builtins/coefficient)‚Äù plugin that you can use. The builtins are convenient because they are bundled with IF - there‚Äôs no need to install any third-party code.
> There are several places you can find model plugins. If you are using a simple coefficient like above, one of the built in models will work out just fine. But perhaps the model is more complex, in that case you can search the Model Explorer for published model plugins that perform more complex activities. Or you can even build your own if no existing plugin works for you. Impact Framework is felxibel and extensible for your use case.


To use the `Multiply` plugin we first need to add it to the context, specifically in the `plugins: initialize` block like so:

```yaml
carbon-from-energy:           # <1>
  method: Multiply            # <2>
  path: "builtin"             # <3>
  config:                     # <4>
    input-parameters:         # <5>  
      - energy  
      - carbon-intensity
    output-parameter: carbon # <6>
```
- <1> This is the name of this **model**, a **model** is an **instance** of a **plugin**.
- <2> `method` is the name of the function you are calling from the model plugin. Here, it is `Multiply`. 
- <3> `path` is the location where the plugin is installed in your `node_modules` folder. For `builtins`, the path is always just `builtin`. You can always check the plugin documentation to find the right values for `method` and `path`.
- <4> `config` is where you configure a model plugin. Each model plugin has different configuration, refer to the model plugin documentation for details. 
- <5> `input-parameters` is an array of input parameters which you want to multiply together.
- <7> `output-parameter` Is the name of paramter you want the result of the multiplication output to. 

> [!NOTE]
> In more complicated IMPs you might have many instances of the same plugin (e.g. you might use the `Multiply` plugin many times). Each instance we call a mode, you can call models whatever you like, but we recommend using very descriptive names, using hyphen separated words.

Adding this to your boilerplate IMP, you get:

```yaml
name: energy-to-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    carbon-from-energy:          
      method: Multiply           
      path: "builtin"            
      config:                    
        input-parameters:        
          - energy  
          - carbon-intensity
        output-parameter: carbon 
tree:
  children:
    server-1:
      defaults:
      pipeline:
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          energy: 0.05
          carbon-intensity: 163
```

### `carbon`

The last step is to add the `carbon-from-energy` model plugin we just configured to the pipeline of the `server-1` component.

There are different types of pipelines you can configure, for the majority of simple use cases you will want to add your model to the `compute` pipeline like so:

```yaml
pipeline:
  compute:
    - carbon-from-energy
```

Adding that to the IMP file yields this:

```yaml
name: energy-to-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    carbon-from-energy:          
      method: Multiply           
      path: "builtin"            
      config:                    
        input-parameters:        
          - energy  
          - carbon-intensity
        output-parameter: carbon 
tree:
  children:
    server-1:
      defaults:
      # highlight-start
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - carbon-from-energy
      # highlight-end          
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          energy: 0.05
          carbon-intensity: 163
```


## Run

Let's review what we've done and where we are at.

- We've added a server component called `server-1`.
- We observed that for a 5 min period of time the energy consumed by `server-1` was 0.05 kWh.
- We added an observation to `server-1` by adding an element to the `inputs` array with an energy parameter of `0.05`.
- We configured a `Coefficient` model plugin called `carbon-from-energy` which uses a hardcoded value for carbon intensity of electricity to convert `energy` into `carbon`.
- We configured the model plugin to run on the `server-1` component, by adding it to the `pipeline` of the component.

Now it's time to actually compute the carbon, make sure you have saved your file as `imp.yml` and run the command below:

```bash
if-run -m imp.yml
```

You will see some logs appear in your console, and then the output IMP file will be printed there too. Two will notice that two blocks of YAML have been added to your original IMP data: `execution` and `outputs`, like so:

```yaml
# start
name: energy-to-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags: null
initialize:
  plugins:
    carbon-from-energy:
      path: builtin
      method: Multiply
      config:
        input-parameters:
          - energy
          - carbon-intensity
        output-parameter: carbon
execution:  # <1>
  command: >-
    /Users/jawache/.nvm/versions/node/v23.11.0/bin/node
    /Users/jawache/.nvm/versions/node/v23.11.0/bin/if-run -m ./src/direct.yml
  environment:
    if-version: 1.0.1
    os: macOS
    os-version: 14.7.5
    node-version: 23.11.0
    date-time: 2025-04-14T19:28:00.818Z (UTC)
    dependencies:
  status: success
tree:
  children:
    server-1:
      defaults: null
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - carbon-from-energy
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          energy: 0.05
          carbon-intensity: 163
      outputs:                          # <2>
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          energy: 0.05
          carbon-intensity: 163
          carbon: 8.15                  # <3>

# end
```
- <1>: `execution` captures information about the runtime environment for your IMP execution.
- <2>: `outputs` includes all your input data with the result of your plugin execution appended to it.
- <3>: You will see in `outputs` the value `8.15` associated with the key `carbon`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Notice the output file contains **all the same information** that was in your manifest. All the plugin declarations, configuration, components, the layout of the tree - it's all there, identically to the original manifest. 
> This is important because it allows others to re-execute your output file. The manifest data is your "working out" - having it here alongside your output data allows others to audit your process as well as your numbers.

Crucially, there are several new sections that have been added to the manifest. These new sections are:

### `execution`

The¬†`execution`¬†section captures the details of the runtime environment that just executed your manifest. This includes details about your operating system, Nodejs and Imapct Framework versions, the date and time the manifest was run, and the packages that are installed in your environment. There is also a¬†`status`¬†field that can either be¬†`success`¬†or¬†`fail`¬†. If the status is¬†`fail`¬†, then the error message is captured and reported here so you can see why your run failed to execute.

### `outputs`

For each component, the results from the execution of each plugin is added to an¬†`outputs`¬†section. In this example, there is only one plugin that returns a single value, so¬†`outputs`¬†is identical to¬†`inputs`¬†but with one additional field -¬†`carbon`¬†.

```yaml
inputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
      duration: 3600
      energy: 0.05
outputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
      duration: 3600
      energy: 0.05
      carbon: 8.15
```

## Review

Congratulations, you just computed the carbon value for your application for a very simple use case. You can do a lot more with IMPs and IF but this simple use case taught you:

- The context and the tree.
- How to configure a component and add observations
- How to congigure a model plugin.
- How to add model plugin to the pipeline for a component.
- How to execute an IMP file and parse the output.


> [!TIP]
> You just computed carbon from energy using the `Multiply` plugin. However, this is not the only way to compute the product of two values in Impact framework. 
> 
> You could also have chosen to use the `Coefficient` plugin
> 
> There is also the WattTime plugin avaialble from the plugin explorer which pulls live Carbon Intensity data by calling the WattTime API so you don't have to hardcode values in the IMP files.

## Test your learning

1. Try swapping out the¬†`Coefficient`¬†plugin for¬†`Multiply`¬†to give the same result.
2. Try varying the values for¬†`energy`¬†and¬†carbon intensity coefficient¬†and observe the changing output
3. Try adding more servers, as new components, and observing how each component's pipeline is executed independently.
4. Try passing your **output** file to Impact framework. Notice that Impact Framework can run your output file as if it were a fresh manifest!
