# Wrap Up

## What You've Learned

Throughout this course you've built up a complete toolkit for measuring the environmental impact of software using Impact Framework.

You started with the basics — a single `Multiply` plugin converting energy into carbon for one server. From there, you learned how to chain plugins into pipelines, using proxy measurements like CPU and memory utilisation to estimate energy when direct measurements aren't available.

In the SCI walkthrough (modules 6–10), you applied the **IDOMI** process — Impacts, Dependencies, Observations, Methodology, Implementation — to build a complete SCI pipeline step by step:

- **Operational energy** from CPU and memory utilisation
- **Operational carbon** using carbon intensity data from the Real Time Cloud dataset
- **Embodied carbon** using the CCF model via `SciEmbodied`
- **The SCI score** itself, dividing total carbon by your functional unit

You then extended this to multiple timesteps, synchronised time series across components with `TimeSync`, and aggregated results across your tree.

Finally, you learned how to scale IDOMI from a single component to a full investigation — scoping the application boundary, grouping components, and applying the familiar process to each one.

## Useful Tools

### The Visualiser

The Impact Framework [visualiser](https://viz.if.greensoftware.foundation) lets you explore your results graphically. Pass it a URL to your output file and it displays a donut chart with sections for each top-level component. You can click into any segment to drill down into child components or view the granular data for leaf components.

Try it with this prepared example from the GSF website investigation:

https://viz.if.greensoftware.foundation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FGreen-Software-Foundation%2Fif-db%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fmanifests%2Fgsf-website%2Fgsf-website-output.yml

### Verifying Manifests with `if-check`

An Impact Framework output file is an executable audit — it contains your results alongside all the input data, configuration, and pipelines that produced them. Anyone can re-run your output file to verify the results.

The tool for this is `if-check`:

```bash
if-check -m outputs.yml
```

This re-executes the file and verifies that the reported results match. If someone disagrees with your methodology or coefficients, they can swap them out, rerun the manifest, and send it back. Environmental impact reporting becomes a discussion rather than a one-way transfer of information.

## What's Next

### Do Your Own Investigation

Use what you've learned to conduct your own investigation:

1. Choose a software application you want to measure
2. Apply the three-phase process from Module 14: **scope** your boundary and components, apply **IDOMI** to each component, then **execute** and review
3. Share your investigation by adding it to the [IF-DB repository](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-db)

### Review Someone Else's Work

Pick an investigation from IF-DB, run it through `if-check`, and review the methodology. What did you like? What could be improved? This peer review process is how the community builds consensus around environmental impact measurements.

### SCI Certificate of Disclosure

The Green Software Foundation runs an **SCI Certificate of Disclosure** programme — a voluntary process where organisations publicly disclose their SCI calculations in a format that anyone can verify. It's not a judgement of whether your software is "green"; it's a badge of methodological transparency.

Everything you've learned in this course — writing manifest files, following IDOMI, documenting your methodology — directly prepares you for certificate submission. Visit the [GSF website](https://greensoftware.foundation) for the latest details on the programme and how to participate.
