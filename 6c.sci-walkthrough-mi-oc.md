Let's revisit our depenancy tree to see what we did and what's remaining.

In this module we are going to work through the methodology for the operational carbon impact which depends on the carbon intensity impact.

## `carbon-intensity`

### Metholdology

As discussed previously there are several good sources to obtain real-time and granular carbon intensity information, including WattTime, Electriciy Maps, UK Grid. We do strongly recommend exploring and using those services since granular carbon intensity data is going to give you the most useful information regarding where to invest efforts in reduction.

For the training course and for other perhaps aggregate reporting purposes we have the RTC project from the GSF which has disclosed official coefficients from the major cloud providers which we can use in a pipeline.

The advantage of the RTC data set is that it alrady has data keyed by cloud provider and cloud region so you don't have to try to figure out where in the world West UK is, however the data is a yearly average so won't surface useful opportunitues for carbon aware computing.

### Implementation

ADD RTC SO IT GIVES US CA

## `operational-carbon`

### Methodology

Now we have `carbon-intensity` and `operational-energy`, we simply need to multiply them together to create `operational-carbon`. 

### Implementation

We will use the Multiply plugin, and configure it to multiply `operational-energy` by `carbon-intensity` and output `operational-carbon` like so:

```yaml
calculate-operational-carbon:
  method: Multiply
  path: builtin
  config:
    input-parameters: 
      - operational-energy
      - carbon-intensity
    output-parameter: operational-carbon
```
## Full Manifest

The full manifest so far now looks like so:

```yaml

      pipeline:

          - tdp-multiplier-to-cpu-power
          - cpu-power-to-cpu-energy
          - to-operational-energy
          - to-operational-carbon
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00
          duration: 3600
          memory-utilization: 8.8
          cpu-utilization: 80
          site-visits: 210
```          

And now if we run in the terminal with 

```bash
if-run -m sci-walkthrough.yml
```

An output manifest is printed to the terminal with these `outputs` appended.

```yaml
outputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00
    duration: 3600
    memory-utilization: 8.8
    cpu-utilization: 80
    site-visits: 210
    cloud-region: West UK
    cloud-instance: Standard_A2m_v2
    cloud-provider: Azure
    carbon-intensity: 120
    memory-energy: 0.003432
    cpu-tdp: 205
    tdp-multiplier: 0.912
    cpu-power: 186.96
    cpu-energy: 0.18696000000000002
    operational-energy: 0.190392
    # highlight-start    
    operational-carbon: 22.84704
    # highlight-end    
```

You can see that we now have a manifest that calcualtes `operational-carbon`, there is still more to do however until we can compute a sci score.
