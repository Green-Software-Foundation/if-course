In this module we are going to work through the methodology for the operational energy component.

### `memory-energy`

### Metholdology

Let's begin with what we know, how to induce memory utilization into energy, we've covered that all in previous modules.

### Implementation

We'll copy across the config from previous modules for this:

          memory-utilization: 8  
```

### `cpu-energy`

#### Methodology

In previous modules, we've covered how to estimate energy consumption from memory utilization using a simple coefficient.

However, estimating energy from **CPU utilization** is more complex since it's a non-linear relationship between cpu utilization and energy. This relatioship is called a **Power Curve**.

**TODO - DIAGRAM**

As utilization increases so does the power, but note interestingly the power does not drop to zero when the utilization is 0% and notice how the relationshipis not linear.

Every single CPU on the market today has a different power curve. To make things even more complex the power curve is different depending on **what types** of applications you are running on the CPU. To make matters even more complex, they can also change depending on how you configure the CPUs BIOS settings.

The ideal case would be for you to have computed your own power curves for your CPUs, for your application and for your BIOS settings. We recommend looking at tools such as TODO and TODO if this is a direction you want to explore.

Alternatively a rudementary soltion is to use a generic power curve and the [Thermal Design Power (TDP)](TODO) of your CPU.

To estimate CPU energy consumption, follow these steps:

1. **Find an appropriate power curve** for the processor.
2. **Interpolate the curve** at your observed CPU utilization to determine the `tdp-factor`.
3. **Multiply the processor's TDP by the `tdp-factor`** to calculate estimated power draw.
4. **Multiply power by time** to get total **energy consumed**.

This is a common approach but also deeply flawed, you won't be able to detect important differences between how different brands and configurations of the hardware perform better than others. Please don't assume that just because that's the approach we are taking in this course to mean that's an approach we recommend, it is convenient form a teaching perspective.

### Selecting a power curve

Finding a processor-specific power curve is ideal but often not practical, as this data can be hard to obtain. 

In most cases, people use a [generalized power curve from this article](https://medium.com/teads-engineering/building-an-aws-ec2-carbon-emissions-dataset-3f0fd76c98ac), which we’ll use here for convenience.

> [!NOTE]
> 📖 Read more in the [Teads pipeline documentation](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/pipelines/teads/). 

Visually representing the above using the teads power curve.

We interpolate off the curve the tdp-factor for a cpu utilization of 80% =~ 0.95

We multiply that tdp-factor by the tdp of the CPU, in this case let's say it's 205 W.

0.95 * 205 = 194.75 W

To get energy from the above we multiply by time, in this case we were running at 80% utilziation for 1hr

194.75 * 1hr = 195.75 Wh

So the energy consumption for running at 80% utilization for 1 hrs on our CPU is approx 195.75 Wh.

**TODO - IMAGE**

#### Implementation

So first we need to induce the `cpu-utilization` to an intermediate value called `tdp-multiplier`.

As described in the methodology you need to interpolate `cpu-utilization` against the power curve of your CPU. We'll use the generalised "teads" power curve which - when generated several years ago - was the average across a range of CPUs.

In the `builtins` library, you can find the `Interpolate` plugin which we can use to implement the above. You’ll name the output `tdp-multiplier` as it is really an intermediate value that needs to be multiplied with the processor TDP to yield the CPU power.

```yaml
...  
    tdp-multiplier-from-cpu-utilization:  # <1>
      method: Interpolation               # <2>
      path: "builtin"
      config:
        method: linear
        x: [0, 10, 50, 100]               # <3>
        y: [0.12, 0.32, 0.75, 1.02]       # <3>  
        input-parameter: cpu-utilization  # <4>
        output-parameter: tdp-multiplier  # <5>      
...
```
- <1>: The name of this model.
- <2>: We are using the `Interpolation` plugin from the builtin standard library.
- <3>: These are the details of the power curve.
- <4>: Which input variable to load the cpu utilziation from.
- <5>: Which output parameter to publish the tdp multiplier to.

We now need to multiply the `tdp-multiplier` by the `tdp` of the CPU. We don't have the tdp of the CPU so we need to source it from somewhere, we do have the cloud-instance and the cloud-provider and from that we should be able to determine the CPU and from that determine the TDP of the CPU.

You can create your own datasets for this but there is an open source dataset maintained by the GSF to aid in this.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The cloud industry moves fast, the data set is open source and commuity maintained. If you have an instance type that can't be found in the dataset, please help the community by researching the correct values and submitting a PR to the dataset to add it in.

```yaml
cloud-instance-to-cpu-tdp:
  method: CSVLookup     # <1>
  path: 'builtin'
  config:
    filepath: /Users/jawache/Development/gsf/if-course/src/cloud-metdata-azure-instances.csv # <2>
    query:              # <3>
      instance-class: "cloud-instance"
    output:             # <4>
      - cpu-tdp           
```          
- <1>: Loads the `CSVLookup` plugin from the standard library.
- <2>: This is a community maintained dataset containining useful metadata regarding Azure instances.
- <3>: The query we want to run, return data from the row in the CSV file where the instance-class column mantches the value in the cloud-instance observation.
- <4>: The CSV has a lot of columns, we just want to output the cpu-tdp column as a new observation.

Now we have `cpu-tdp` and the `tdp-multiplier` we can multiply them together to figure out the actual power usage of the CPU using a simplle `Multiply` plugin like so:


```yaml
tdp-multiplier-to-power:
  method: Multiply
  path: builtin
  config:
    input-parameters: 
      - tdp-multiplier
      - cpu-tdp
    output-parameter: "cpu-power" 
```

The above returns the `cpu-power` in the unit of `Watts`. **Power** is not equal to **energy**, however since the observation is for the duration of an hour, the above also happens to be the same as Watt-hours (Wh).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reseach and learn the difference between power and energy (TODO), the above is a happy accident, if your observation is not for 1hr you will need to do some maths to get it in Wh.


We need the energy in **kWh** since that's the unit required for the SCI calculation. To convert Wh to KWh we simply divide by 1000, let's use the `Divide` plugin like so:

```yaml
power-to-energy:
  method: Divide
  path: "builtin"
  config:
    numerator: cpu-power
    denominator: 1000
    output: cpu-energy
```

### `operational-energy`

We now have cpu-energy and memory-energy, the next step is just to sum them up to create operational-energy, let's use the `Sum` plugin, like so:

```yaml
sum-energy:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sum
  config:
    input-parameters:
      - memory-energy
      - cpu-energy
    output-parameter: operational-energy
```

Our manifest file now looks something like so:

```yaml

    memory-utilization-to-memory-energy:

        query:              
          instance-class: "cloud-instance"
        output:             
          - cpu-tdp

        input-parameter: "cpu-utilization"
        output-parameter: "tdp-multiplier"
    tdp-multiplier-to-cpu-power:
      method: Multiply
      path: builtin
      config:
        input-parameters: 
          - tdp-multiplier
          - cpu-tdp
        output-parameter: "cpu-power"

    sum-all-energy-to-operational-energy:

      method: Sum
      config:

        cloud-instance: Standard_A2m_v2
        cloud-provider: Azure        
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - memory-utilization-to-memory-energy
          - cloud-instance-to-cpu-tdp
          - cpu-utilization-to-tdp-multiplier
          - tdp-multiplier-to-cpu-power
          - cpu-power-to-cpu-energy
          - sum-all-energy-to-operational-energy
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00
          duration: 3600
          memory-utilization: 8.8
          cpu-utilization: 80
          site-visits: 210
```

And now if we run in the terminal with 

```bash
if-run -m sci-walkthrough.yml
```

An output manifest is printed to the terminal with these `outputs` appended.

```yaml
outputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00
    duration: 3600
    memory-utilization: 8.8
    cpu-utilization: 80
    site-visits: 210
    cloud-region: West UK
    cloud-instance: Standard_A2m_v2
    cloud-provider: Azure
    memory-energy: 0.003432
    cpu-tdp: 205
    tdp-multiplier: 0.912
    cpu-power: 186.96
    cpu-energy: 0.18696000000000002
    # highlight-start
    operational-energy: 0.190392
    # highlight-end
```

You can see that we now have a manifest that calcualtes `operational-energy`.



## Embodied Carbon

The virtual machine you are using is an `Azure Standard A2m_v2`. [This instance has](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-av2-series-vm-sizes/) 2 VCPUs, 16 GB memory, a 20 GB SD and no GPUs.

The plugin initialization is extremely simple - you do not have to provide any config data at all unless you want to override some default settings, which you don’t here. You can simply add the following to your `initialize: plugins:` block:

```yaml
initialize:
  plugins:
		embodied-carbon:
		  path: builtin
		  method: SciEmbodied
```

Then the following information can be added to your input array (or you could add it to `defaults` with the same effect.

```yaml
inputs:
	- vCPUs: 2
	- memory: 16
	- SSD: 1
```

This is all that is required for the `SciEmbodied` model to run. It will add the total embodied emissions for the server to the output data using the name `embodied-carbon`.

## Operational & Embodied

Now that you have two components that sum to give the total carbon (operational and embodied) you should rename your existing `carbon` parameter to `operational-carbon`. This means the name `carbon` is freed up for the sum of operational and embodied carbon.

You can add an instance of `Sum` to sum together the embodied and operational carbon components:

```yaml
sum-carbon-components:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sum
  config:
    input-parameters:
      - operational-carbon
      - embodied-carbon
    output-parameter: carbon
```

## SCI

There is only one more step to calculate the SCI score. You must choose a suitable functional unit and divide your total carbon by it to yield SCI.

Let’s say your application is a website. A suitable functional unit would be unique visits per day. This gives an idea of how carbon efficient your application is, as reducing the SCI score means reducing the carbon emitted by each user. 

You can simply add `site-visits` to your input data, let’s say there were 550 visits. In a real application, this information could come from a service like Google Analytics.

Now, add the SCI builtin to your set of plugins. You have to specify your functional unit in the plugin config, as follows:

```yaml
sci:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sci
  config:
    functional-unit: site-visits
```

Add `sci` to the component pipeline, and you’ve completed your end-to-end SCI IMP! Now all that’s required is to run it and view the results.
