# Do your own investigation!

---

- Use what you learned in this training course to conduct your own investigation.
- Start by choosing a software application you want to measure. Capture it in a manifest file and compute it using Impact Framework.
- Share your investigation by adding it to our IF-DB repository! You'll need to submit:
    - your manifest file
    - your output file
    - some explanatory notes
    - a short blog-post style write up

# Review someone else's work

- Pick an investigation from IF-DB
- Review it - what did you like? What could be improved?
- Add your review as comments on GitHub
