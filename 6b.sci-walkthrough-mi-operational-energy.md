In this module we are going to work through the methodology for the operational energy component.

### `memory-energy`

### Methodology

Let's begin with what we know, how to induce memory utilization into energy, we've covered that all in previous modules.

### Implementation

We'll copy across the config from previous modules for this:

          memory-utilization: 8  
```

### `cpu-energy`

#### Methodology

In previous modules, we've covered how to estimate energy consumption from memory utilization using a simple coefficient.

However, estimating energy from **CPU utilization** is more complex since it's a non-linear relationship between cpu utilization and energy. This relationship is called a **Power Curve**.

As utilization increases so does the power, but note interestingly the power does not drop to zero when the utilization is 0% and notice how the relationship is not linear.

Every single CPU on the market today has a different power curve. To make things even more complex the power curve is different depending on **what types** of applications you are running on the CPU. To make matters even more complex, they can also change depending on how you configure the CPUs BIOS settings.

The ideal case would be for you to have computed your own power curves for your CPUs, for your application and for your BIOS settings. We recommend looking at tools such as [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre) (for power measurement) and [PowerTOP](https://github.com/fenrus75/powertop) (for Linux systems) if this is a direction you want to explore.

Alternatively a rudimentary solution is to use a generic power curve and the [Thermal Design Power (TDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power) of your CPU.

To estimate CPU energy consumption, follow these steps:

1. **Find an appropriate power curve** for the processor.
2. **Interpolate the curve** at your observed CPU utilization to determine the `tdp-factor`.
3. **Multiply the processor's TDP by the `tdp-factor`** to calculate estimated power draw.
4. **Multiply power by time** to get total **energy consumed**.

This is a common approach but also deeply flawed, you won't be able to detect important differences between how different brands and configurations of the hardware perform better than others. Please don't assume that just because that's the approach we are taking in this course to mean that's an approach we recommend, it is convenient from a teaching perspective.

### Selecting a power curve

Finding a processor-specific power curve is ideal but often not practical, as this data can be hard to obtain. 

In most cases, people use a [generalized power curve from this article](https://medium.com/teads-engineering/building-an-aws-ec2-carbon-emissions-dataset-3f0fd76c98ac), which we’ll use here for convenience.

> [!NOTE]
> 📖 Read more in the [Teads pipeline documentation](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/pipelines/teads/). 

Visually representing the above using the teads power curve.

We interpolate off the curve the tdp-factor for a cpu utilization of 80% =~ 0.95

We multiply that tdp-factor by the tdp of the CPU, in this case let's say it's 205 W.

0.95 * 205 = 194.75 W

To get energy from the above we multiply by time, in this case we were running at 80% utilization for 1hr

194.75 * 1hr = 194.75 Wh

So the energy consumption for running at 80% utilization for 1 hr on our CPU is approx 194.75 Wh.


#### Implementation

So first we need to induce the `cpu-utilization` to an intermediate value called `tdp-multiplier`.

As described in the methodology you need to interpolate `cpu-utilization` against the power curve of your CPU. We'll use the generalised "teads" power curve which - when generated several years ago - was the average across a range of CPUs.

In the `builtins` library, you can find the `Interpolate` plugin which we can use to implement the above. You’ll name the output `tdp-multiplier` as it is really an intermediate value that needs to be multiplied with the processor TDP to yield the CPU power.

```yaml
...  
    tdp-multiplier-from-cpu-utilization:  # <1>
      method: Interpolation               # <2>
      path: "builtin"
      config:
        method: linear
        x: [0, 10, 50, 100]               # <3>
        y: [0.12, 0.32, 0.75, 1.02]       # <3>  
        input-parameter: cpu-utilization  # <4>
        output-parameter: tdp-multiplier  # <5>      
...
```
- <1>: The name of this model.
- <2>: We are using the `Interpolation` plugin from the builtin standard library.
- <3>: These are the details of the power curve.
- <4>: Which input variable to load the cpu utilization from.
- <5>: Which output parameter to publish the tdp multiplier to.

We now need to multiply the `tdp-multiplier` by the `tdp` of the CPU. We don't have the tdp of the CPU so we need to source it from somewhere, we do have the cloud-instance and the cloud-provider and from that we should be able to determine the CPU and from that determine the TDP of the CPU.

You can create your own datasets for this but there is an open source dataset maintained by the GSF to aid in this.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The cloud industry moves fast, the data set is open source and community maintained. If you have an instance type that can't be found in the dataset, please help the community by researching the correct values and submitting a PR to the dataset to add it in.

```yaml
cloud-instance-to-cpu-tdp:
  method: CSVLookup     # <1>
  path: 'builtin'
  config:
    filepath: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if-course/refs/heads/main/src/cloud-metdata-azure-instances.csv # <2>
    query:              # <3>
      instance-class: "cloud-instance"
    output:             # <4>
      - cpu-tdp
```          
- <1>: Loads the `CSVLookup` plugin from the standard library.
- <2>: This is a community maintained dataset containing useful metadata regarding Azure instances.
- <3>: The query we want to run, return data from the row in the CSV file where the instance-class column matches the value in the cloud-instance observation.
- <4>: The CSV has a lot of columns, we just want to output the cpu-tdp column as a new observation.

Now we have `cpu-tdp` and the `tdp-multiplier` we can multiply them together to figure out the actual power usage of the CPU using a simple `Multiply` plugin like so:


```yaml
tdp-multiplier-to-power:
  method: Multiply
  path: builtin
  config:
    input-parameters: 
      - tdp-multiplier
      - cpu-tdp
    output-parameter: "cpu-power" 
```

The above returns the `cpu-power` in the unit of `Watts`. **Power** is not equal to **energy**, however since the observation is for the duration of an hour, the above also happens to be the same as Watt-hours (Wh).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Power vs Energy:** Power (measured in Watts) is the *rate* at which energy is consumed at a specific moment in time. Energy (measured in Watt-hours) is the *total amount* of power consumed over a period of time. The relationship is: **Energy = Power × Time**. In our example, we have power in Watts and a duration of 1 hour, so the energy happens to numerically equal the power (e.g., 195 Watts × 1 hour = 195 Wh). However, if your observation is not for 1 hour, you need to multiply power by the duration in hours to get energy in Wh.


We need the energy in **kWh** since that's the unit required for the SCI calculation. To convert Wh to KWh we simply divide by 1000, let's use the `Divide` plugin like so:

```yaml
power-to-energy:
  method: Divide
  path: "builtin"
  config:
    numerator: cpu-power
    denominator: 1000
    output: cpu-energy
```

### `operational-energy`

We now have cpu-energy and memory-energy, the next step is just to sum them up to create operational-energy, let's use the `Sum` plugin, like so:

```yaml
sum-energy:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sum
  config:
    input-parameters:
      - memory-energy
      - cpu-energy
    output-parameter: operational-energy
```

Our manifest file now looks something like so:

```yaml

        query:
          instance-class: "cloud-instance"
        output:

        input-parameter: "cpu-utilization"
        output-parameter: "tdp-multiplier"
    tdp-multiplier-to-cpu-power:
      method: Multiply
      path: builtin
      config:
        input-parameters: 
          - tdp-multiplier
          - cpu-tdp

      method: Sum
      config:

  children:
    server-1:
      defaults:

        cloud-provider: Azure        
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - memory-utilization-to-memory-energy
          - cloud-instance-to-cpu-tdp
          - cpu-utilization-to-tdp-multiplier
          - tdp-multiplier-to-cpu-power
          - cpu-power-to-cpu-energy
          - sum-all-energy-to-operational-energy
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00

          memory-utilization: 8.8
          cpu-utilization: 80
          site-visits: 210
```

And now if we run in the terminal with 

```bash
if-run -m sci-walkthrough.yml
```

An output manifest is printed to the terminal with these `outputs` appended.

```yaml
outputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00
    duration: 3600
    memory-utilization: 8.8
    cpu-utilization: 80
    site-visits: 210
    cloud-region: West UK
    cloud-instance: Standard_A2m_v2
    cloud-provider: Azure
    memory-energy: 0.003432
    cpu-tdp: 205
    tdp-multiplier: 0.912
    cpu-power: 186.96
    cpu-energy: 0.18696000000000002
    # highlight-start
    operational-energy: 0.190392
    # highlight-end
```

You can see that we now have a manifest that calculates `operational-energy`, we've done a lot but we have a little bit more to go to complete the rest.
