In the previous example, we calculated carbon emissions based on an observation of energy usage from a server’s CPU. However, servers include other components that also produce emissions, such as memory.

In this next example, you'll add a **memory component** to the server to create a more complete picture of the overall carbon emissions. You'll work with a **single component** (the server) and chain **two plugins** together, providing an opportunity to become familiar and comfortable with building pipelines from multiple plugins.

You will try to use this to **work out your carbon emissions for one hour.**

## IDOMI

As introduced in the previous module, the standard development process involves these 5 steps.

1. **Impacts**: What impact(s) do you want to compute?
2. **Dependancies**: Start building up an **impact dependancy tree**.
3. **Observations**: What observation(s) can you gather that *could* be induced to an impact via a methodology?
4. **Methodology**: What methodology will you select for inducing the observation(s), into the impact(s)?
5. **Implementation**: Implementation of the methodology as a pipeline of plugins.

## Impacts

Nothing changes here, we are still interested in computing the `carbon` impact of our server.

## Dependancies & Observation

We start with the same impact dependancy tree as the last module, like so:

☑️ carbon 
- 🌿 cpu-energy
- 🌿 carbon-intensity

You want to add the carbon impact from memory to the picture so you look into what metrics are exposed via the cloud provider’s monitor API and find that **all** you have available is `memory utilisation`.

You will need to induce `memory utilisation` into `memory-energy` using a methodology. Memory energy is therefore an impact dependancy and memory utilisation is an observation. Let's add these to our impact dependancy tree like so:

☑️ carbon 
- 🌿 carbon-intensity
- ☑️ energy
  - 🌿 cpu-energy
  - ☑️ memory-energy
    - 🌿 memory-utilisation

## Methodology & Implementation

### `memory-energy`

You look at the monitor dashboard and see that it returned the average memory utilisation across the last hour was `8.8 GB`.

Let's add this as an observation to out server like so:

```yaml
inputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
    duration: 3600
    cpu-energy: 0.05                 
    memory-utilization: 8.8          
```

Now, you have to do a little research to determine what to do with that memory untilization. **Memory utilisation is a proxy measurement for energy consumption** which is in itself a proxy for the metric you really want, which is carbon emissions. So you have to search the literature, look for models that have been proposed elsewhere for turning memory utilisation into energy or carbon.

[**Cloud Carbon Footprint**](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/) proposes a **coefficient for converting memory utilisation into energy**, which gets you one step closer to your goal.

They suggest that multiplying memory utilisation in gigabytes by a `0.000392 kWh/GBh` is appropriate for a first-order estimate of the energy consumption due to memory. This value is derived from averaging the values proposed by two industry power models.

Now you can apply your coefficient to yield an energy value in kWh.

```mathematica
8.8 (GB) * 0.000392 (kWh/GBh) = 0.003432 kWh
```

Let's represent this as a model in the manifest file. Since the model is a simple coefficeint that will be the same for all components in our manifest we will use the `Coefficient` plugin. Add the below to the plugin -> initialize section in the manifest file.
```yaml
energy-from-memory-utilization:         # <1>
  method: Coefficient
  path: "builtin"
  config:
    input-parameter: memory-utilization # <2>
    coefficient: 0.00039                # <3>
    output-parameter: memory-energy     # <4>
```
- <1>: The name of the plugin instance.
- <2>: This instance of the `Coefficient` plugin reads `memory-utilization` from the input observation.
- <3>: The coefficient we reasearched in the methodology section above.
- <4>: The plugin will output `memory-energy`, the result of multiplying `memory-utilization` by `0.00039`

Finally we need to make sure this model is added to the pipeline for the component like so:

```yaml
server-1:
  defaults:
  pipeline:
    compute:
      - energy-from-memory-utilization 
  inputs:
    - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
      duration: 3600
      cpu-energy: 0.05                 
      memory-utilization: 8.8          
```

### `energy`

The energy from the cpu is now `cpu-energy` and `energy-from-memory-utilization` will output `memory-energy` but `carbon-from-energy` expects `energy` as an input.

We will need to sum both `memory-energy` and `cpu-energy` into `energy`. To do that we will use another plugin from the standard library `Sum`. Again, let's first configure this plugin in the initialise section, like so:

```yaml
sum-energy: 
  path: "builtin" 
  method: Sum                 # <1>	                 
  config:
    input-parameters:         # <2>	
      - memory-energy
      - cpu-energy
    output-parameter: energy  # <3>	  
```
- <1>: The plugin to load from the standard library, `Sum` in this case.
- <2>: The array of observation parameters you want to sum up to a total.
- <3>: The parameter name you want to output to, in this case `energy`.

And let's add it to the pipeline like so:

Finally we need to make sure this model is added to the pipeline for the component like so:

```yaml
server-1:
  defaults:
  pipeline:
    compute:
      - energy-from-memory-utilization 
      # highlight-next-line
      - sum-energy
  inputs:
    - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
      duration: 3600
      cpu-energy: 0.05                 
      memory-utilization: 8.8          
```

### `carbon`

Looking at our impact dependancy tree:

☑️ carbon 
- 🌿 carbon-intensity
- ✅ energy
  - 🌿 cpu-energy
  - ✅ memory-energy
    - 🌿 memory-utilisation

We now have everything we need to compute carbon, which is simply the `energy` multiplied ny the `carbon-intensity` which we implemented in the previous module already like so:

```yaml
carbon-from-energy:          
  method: Multiply           
  path: "builtin"            
  config:                    
    input-parameters:        
      - energy  
      - carbon-intensity
    output-parameter: carbon 
```        

And just like before we add this model to the pipeline of our component, like so:

```yaml
server-1:
  defaults:
  pipeline:
    compute:
      - energy-from-memory-utilization 
      - sum-energy
      # highlight-next-line
      - carbon-from-energy
  inputs:
    - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
      duration: 3600
      cpu-energy: 0.05       
      carbon-intensity: 163          
      memory-utilization: 8.8          
```

Our final manifest file looks like this:

```yaml
name: server-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    carbon-from-energy:
      method: Coefficient
      path: "builtin"
      config:
        input-parameter: energy
        coefficient: 163
        output-parameter: carbon
    energy-from-memory-utilization:        
      method: Coefficient
      path: "builtin"
      config:
        input-parameter: memory-utilization 
        coefficient: 0.00039                
        output-parameter: memory-energy     
    sum-energy: 
      path: "builtin" 
      method: Sum                                
      config:
        input-parameters:         
          - memory-energy
          - cpu-energy
        output-parameter: energy  
tree:
  children:
    server-1:
      defaults:
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - energy-from-memory-utilization  
          - sum-energy                      
          - carbon-from-energy   
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cpu-energy: 0.05                 
          memory-utilization: 8.8         
```

## Computation

Now you can run the IMP using:

```yaml
if-run -m imp.yml -o out.yml
```

The output manifest file should look something like so:

```yaml
name: server-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags: null
initialize:
  plugins:
    carbon-from-energy:
      path: builtin
      method: Multiply
      config:
        input-parameters:
          - energy
          - carbon-intensity
        output-parameter: carbon
    energy-from-memory-utilization:
      path: builtin
      method: Coefficient
      config:
        input-parameter: memory-utilization
        coefficient: 0.00039
        output-parameter: memory-energy
    sum-energy:
      path: builtin
      method: Sum
      config:
        input-parameters:
          - memory-energy
          - cpu-energy
        output-parameter: energy
execution:
  command: >-
    /Users/jawache/.nvm/versions/node/v23.11.0/bin/node
    /Users/jawache/.nvm/versions/node/v23.11.0/bin/if-run -m ./src/proxy.yml
  environment:
    if-version: 1.0.1
    os: macOS
    os-version: 14.7.5
    node-version: 23.11.0
    date-time: 2025-04-14T21:41:19.822Z (UTC)
    dependencies:
  status: success
tree:
  children:
    server-1:
      defaults: null
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - energy-from-memory-utilization
          - sum-energy
          - carbon-from-energy
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cpu-energy: 0.05
          memory-utilization: 8.8
          carbon-intensity: 163
      outputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cpu-energy: 0.05
          memory-utilization: 8.8
          carbon-intensity: 163
          # highlight-start
          memory-energy: 0.003432
          energy: 0.053432
          carbon: 8.709416000000001
          # highlight-end
```

So from the manifest output we can see that the carbon emissions of our server is **8.71g CO2e**.

## Conclusion

In this module, we learned how to handle **proxy measurements** within the Impact Framework by converting indirect metrics, like memory utilization, into meaningful carbon emissions data. 

By chaining multiple plugins together, we demonstrated how to create sophisticated pipelines that first convert memory utilization to energy, and then energy to carbon emissions. 

This methodology highlights the flexibility and modularity of IMP files, making your impact assessments both transparent and auditable.

Next, you can further expand on this approach by incorporating additional components or plugins, enabling an even more comprehensive understanding of your software’s environmental footprint.
