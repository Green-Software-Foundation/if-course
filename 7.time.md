## Managing Time Series Data with the Time Feature

In the context of environmental impact assessment, data often comes in the form of **time series**, where observations of various metrics are recorded at specific points in time with associated durations. The Impact Framework inherently works with time series data, as each **observation** within a component's `inputs` array includes a **`timestamp`** indicating the start time of the observation and a **`duration`** specifying the length of the observation period. The collection of these timestamped observations forms the time series for that particular component.

However, a manifest file can encompass numerous components, each potentially having its own time series data. These individual time series might **vary in their start and end times, their temporal resolution (frequency of observations), and may even contain gaps** where data is missing. This heterogeneity in time series can pose challenges for tasks such as aggregation, visualisation, and performing meaningful comparisons between different components.

To address these challenges, Impact Framework provides a built-in **`time-sync` feature**. This feature allows for the **synchronisation of time series across all the components within a manifest file's tree**. The `time-sync` feature takes a **global start time, end time, and a common interval (resolution)** as configuration. It then processes each component's time series to conform to this global temporal configuration. This process involves several key steps:

*   **Upsampling:** Each time series is first upsampled to a common base resolution (typically 1 second) to create a more granular foundation.
*   **Gap Filling:** Any discontinuities or gaps within a component's time series (periods where no data was recorded) are filled in with **"zero objects"**. These are observations with the same structure as the real data but with all usage metrics set to zero, effectively assuming no activity occurred during the missing periods.
*   **Start and End Time Alignment:** The `time-sync` feature compares the start and end times of each component's time series with the globally defined start and end times. If a component's data starts after the global start, the beginning of its time series is padded with "zero objects" to align the start times. Conversely, if a component's data starts before the global start, the initial observations are trimmed. A similar trimming logic is applied to the end times to ensure all time series end at the global end time.
*   **Batching to Interval:** Once the start and end times are synchronised and any discontinuities are handled, the upsampled time series are then **batched together into time bins** according to the globally specified `interval`. This ensures that all synchronised time series have an identical temporal resolution.

The `time-sync` feature can be configured within a component's `pipeline` in the manifest file. While it can be placed at various points in the pipeline, it is generally **recommended to position `time-sync` as the first plugin** whenever possible. This is because operating on fewer parameters earlier in the pipeline can improve efficiency, and it ensures that all subsequent plugins receive consistently synchronised time series data. However, specific use cases might necessitate placing `time-sync` at a different point in the pipeline, and users should be aware of the potential impact this might have on the final results. The padding with zero values can also be toggled off in the manifest if a strict requirement for continuous, originally provided time series exists.

By yielding synchronised time series across all components, the `time-sync` feature greatly facilitates visualisation, intercomparison, and is a prerequisite for the framework's aggregation functionality. For more details, refer to the **Time** documentation.

## Working with Time Series in Inputs

So far in this course, the example IMPs have only had a single element in the `inputs` array. However, real applications will track usage metrics over time, meaning `inputs` will contain time series data with multiple observations.

When there are multiple observations, the `inputs` array contains more than one object. Each one must have a `timestamp` and `duration`. When the length of `inputs` is greater than one, Impact Framework will pass each and every element in `inputs` through the plugin pipeline. Every entry in `inputs` is treated identically and atomically. 

An `inputs` array with three timesteps might look as follows:

```yaml
inputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00
    duration: 3600
    memory-utilization: 8.8
    cpu-utilization: 80
    tdp: 205
    memory-coefficient: 0.00039
    carbon-intensity: 163
  - timestamp: 2023-08-02T00:00
    duration: 3600
    memory-utilization: 2.1
    cpu-utilization: 60
    tdp: 205
    memory-coefficient: 0.00039
    carbon-intensity: 163
  - timestamp: 2023-08-03T00:00
    duration: 3600
    memory-utilization: 19.5
    cpu-utilization: 70
    tdp: 205
    memory-coefficient: 0.00039
    carbon-intensity: 163
```

When your IMP runs, Impact Framework applies each plugin in your pipeline to each element in your inputs array. In `outputs`, although the values might vary, the fields in each element will be identical, because an identical set of plugins was executed.

With the three-entry `inputs` described above, your outputs could look as follows:

```yaml
outputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-08-01T00:00
    duration: 3600
    memory-utilization: 8.8
    cpu-utilization: 80
