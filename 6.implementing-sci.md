# From Carbon to SCI

---

<aside>
ü§î

We are now changing the impact to SCI. This should perhaps be another section. The change in impact means a change in methodology and a change in pipelines and plugins.

</aside>

So far, you have focused on carbon emissions, measured in gCO2e. Very often, you will want to go a step further and express software carbon in terms of an Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) score. 

The SCI score is calculated as follows:

```mathematica
SCI = (E * I + M) / R
```

- `E` is operational energy
- `I` is carbon intensity
- `M` is embodied carbon
- `R` is the functional unit.

## Embodied Carbon

You‚Äôll notice that the steps you have taken so far have all been contributing to the `(E*I)` part of the SCI equation. This is the ‚Äúoperational‚Äù part. The operational energy is the energy used to power your application while it is running. Multiplying operational energy by carbon intensity yields **operational carbon**.

Operational carbon is not the totality of the carbon associated with an application. Carbon was emitted when the hardware used to run an application was manufactured and more will be emitted when the hardware is disposed of. This is the ‚Äúembodied‚Äù or ‚Äúembedded‚Äù carbon, with the symbol `M` in the `SCI` equation.

Calculating embodied emissions is difficult. They typically come from manufacturers conducting life cycle assessments for the products they sell and sharing the total embodied carbon in a data sheet. However, few manufacturers do this, and those that do tend to only do it for a subset of their products. This means we often have to find analogs or models to estimate embodied carbon for hardware components.

A popular model for embodied carbon is the one published in https://medium.com/teads-engineering/building-an-aws-ec2-carbon-emissions-dataset-3f0fd76c98ac, which is also used by [Cloud Carbon Footprint.](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/embodied-emissions) They define a minimal ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù rack server with a given embodied carbon value, and then specify how much carbon to add to the baseline for each additional component your real server has.

The Impact Framework `builtins` has a plugin, `SciEmbodied`, for executing this model. You simply specify your hardware in your input data and it calculates the embodied carbon using the CCF model.

The VM you are using is an `Azure Standard A2m_v2`. [This instance has](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-av2-series-vm-sizes/) 2 VCPUs, 16 GB memory, a 20 GB SD and no GPUs.

The plugin initialization is extremely simple - you do not have to provide any config data at all unless you want to override some default settings, which you don‚Äôt here. You can simply add the following to your `initialize: plugins:` block:

```yaml
initialize:
  plugins:
		embodied-carbon:
		  path: builtin
		  method: SciEmbodied
```

Then the following information can be added to your input array (or you could add it to `defaults` with the same effect.

```yaml
inputs:
	- vCPUs: 2
	- memory: 16
	- SSD: 1
```

This is all that is required for the `SciEmbodied` model to run. It will add the total embodied emissions for the server to the output data using the name `embodied-carbon`.

## Operational & Embodied

Now that you have two components that sum to give the total carbon (operational and embodied) you should rename your existing `carbon` parameter to `operational-carbon`. This means the name `carbon` is freed up for the sum of operational and embodied carbon.

You can add an instance of `Sum` to sum together the embodied and operational carbon components:

```yaml
sum-carbon-components:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sum
  config:
    input-parameters:
      - operational-carbon
      - embodied-carbon
    output-parameter: carbon
```

## SCI

There is only one more step to calculate the SCI score. You must choose a suitable functional unit and divide your total carbon by it to yield SCI.

Let‚Äôs say your application is a website. A suitable functional unit would be unique visits per day. This gives an idea of how carbon efficient your application is, as reducing the SCI score means reducing the carbon emitted by each user. 

You can simply add `site-visits` to your input data, let‚Äôs say there were 550 visits. In a real application, this information could come from a service like Google Analytics.

Now, add the SCI builtin to your set of plugins. You have to specify your functional unit in the plugin config, as follows:

```yaml
sci:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sci
  config:
    functional-unit: site-visits
```

Add `sci` to the component pipeline, and you‚Äôve completed your end-to-end SCI IMP! Now all that‚Äôs required is to run it and view the results.
