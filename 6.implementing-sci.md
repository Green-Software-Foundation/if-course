# SCI Walkthrough - Part 1

So far we have focussed on computing the impact `carbon`. In the previous module we learned about the `SCI` specification, in terms of Impact Framework `SCI` is an impact. 

In this module we will continue with our worked example but transform the impact from `carbon` to `sci`.

## Operational Carbon



>>>>> I AM HERE - PERHAPS MOVE TO PROXY IN THIS CASE ALSO!







As a reminder, the SCI score is calculated as follows:

```mathematica
SCI = (E * I + M) / R
```

- `E` is operational energy
- `I` is carbon intensity
- `M` is embodied carbon
- `R` is the functional unit.

In the SCI specification `(E * I)` is often expressed as simply `O`, operational carbon, like so:

```mathematica
SCI = (O + M) / R
```

- `O` is operational carbon
- `M` is embodied carbon
- `R` is the functional unit.

So far all we have been computing is operational carbon. 

> [!TIP]
> The best practice in computing SCI with Impact Framework is to use the named impacts `operational-carbon` and `embodied-carbon` to represent `O` and `M` in the equation.

Let's adjust the context in our previous IMP files so they now calculate `operational-carbon` instead of `carbon`.

```yaml
name: server-carbon
description: minimal demo
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    energy-from-memory-utilization:        
      method: Coefficient
      path: "builtin"
      config:
        input-parameter: memory-utilization 
        coefficient: 0.00039                
        output-parameter: memory-energy     
    sum-energy:                            
      path: "builtin" 
      method: Sum                                
      config:
        input-parameters:         
          - memory-energy
          - cpu-energy
        output-parameter: operational-energy    # <1>        
    carbon-from-energy:       
      method: Coefficient
      path: "builtin"
      config:
        input-parameter: operational-energy     # <2>        
        coefficient: 163
        output-parameter: operational-carbon    # <3>        
...       
```
- <1>: renamed `energy` to `operational-energy`
- <2>: renamed `energy` to `operational-energy`
- <3>: renamed `carbon` to `operational-carbon`

If we execute the IMP file now it would return this in the outputs:

```yaml
outputs:
    - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
        duration: 3600
        memory-utilization: 8.8
        operational-energy: 0.003432
        operational-carbon: 0.559416
```

## Embodied Carbon

The virtual machine you are using is an `Azure Standard A2m_v2`. [This instance has](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-av2-series-vm-sizes/) 2 VCPUs, 16 GB memory, a 20 GB SD and no GPUs.

The plugin initialization is extremely simple - you do not have to provide any config data at all unless you want to override some default settings, which you don’t here. You can simply add the following to your `initialize: plugins:` block:

```yaml
initialize:
  plugins:
		embodied-carbon:
		  path: builtin
		  method: SciEmbodied
```

Then the following information can be added to your input array (or you could add it to `defaults` with the same effect.

```yaml
inputs:
	- vCPUs: 2
	- memory: 16
	- SSD: 1
```

This is all that is required for the `SciEmbodied` model to run. It will add the total embodied emissions for the server to the output data using the name `embodied-carbon`.

## Operational & Embodied

Now that you have two components that sum to give the total carbon (operational and embodied) you should rename your existing `carbon` parameter to `operational-carbon`. This means the name `carbon` is freed up for the sum of operational and embodied carbon.

You can add an instance of `Sum` to sum together the embodied and operational carbon components:

```yaml
sum-carbon-components:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sum
  config:
    input-parameters:
      - operational-carbon
      - embodied-carbon
    output-parameter: carbon
```

## SCI

There is only one more step to calculate the SCI score. You must choose a suitable functional unit and divide your total carbon by it to yield SCI.

Let’s say your application is a website. A suitable functional unit would be unique visits per day. This gives an idea of how carbon efficient your application is, as reducing the SCI score means reducing the carbon emitted by each user. 

You can simply add `site-visits` to your input data, let’s say there were 550 visits. In a real application, this information could come from a service like Google Analytics.

Now, add the SCI builtin to your set of plugins. You have to specify your functional unit in the plugin config, as follows:

```yaml
sci:
  path: "builtin"
  method: Sci
  config:
    functional-unit: site-visits
```

Add `sci` to the component pipeline, and you’ve completed your end-to-end SCI IMP! Now all that’s required is to run it and view the results.
