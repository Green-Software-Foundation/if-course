# TODO

## Next Up

- [ ] Build `if-viz` CLI tool — serves output file locally and opens visualiser with live reload
- [ ] Update Module 1 visualiser screenshots to match `quickstart-imp.yaml` output (images `1.quickstart.viz-1.png`, `2.quickstart.viz-2.png`, `2.quickstart.viz-3.png`, `2.quickstart.viz-4.png`)
- [ ] Module 8: Complete the RTC (Real Time Carbon) CSVLookup section for carbon-intensity — currently has a TODO placeholder and carbon-intensity is hardcoded as `120` in defaults
- [ ] Module 9: Complete the embodied carbon implementation — methodology section is good but the full manifest with `SciEmbodied` + `cloud-instance-metadata` (output: "*") is missing. The bottom half was stale copy-paste from module 8 and has been removed.
