## Introduction

**Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)** is a crucial metric within the realm of green software, designed to provide a standardized way of understanding the **carbon efficiency of software applications**.

The SCI is a versatile tool applicable across different software domains, use cases, and scales. It describes the methodology for calculating total carbon emissions and the selection criteria to convert the total into a **rate**. By normalizing emissions into a rate, the SCI facilitates comparisons between different versions of the same software or even between different applications providing similar functionalities.

As defined by the specification, the SCI is calculated using the formula:

`SCI = (E * I + M) per R`

Here's a breakdown of each component:

* **E (Energy consumed by software in kWh):** This represents the **operational energy** used by the software during a specific period. This energy consumption is often estimated from various observations like CPU utilization, memory usage, and network traffic, processed through energy models.
  
* **I (Carbon emitted per kWh of energy, gCO2/kWh):** This is the **carbon intensity** of the energy source powering the software's operation. It reflects the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted for each unit of electricity produced. This value can vary significantly based on geographic location and the time at which the energy is consumed, depending on the mix of energy sources in the grid (e.g., fossil fuels, renewables).
  
* **M (Carbon emitted through the hardware that the software is running on):** This represents the **embodied carbon** associated with the hardware infrastructure on which the software operates. Embodied carbon accounts for the greenhouse gases emitted during the manufacturing, transportation, use, and disposal of the hardware components. Estimating embodied carbon can be complex and often relies on lifecycle assessments or models.
  
* **R (Functional Unit; this is how software scales, for example, per user or per device):** The functional unit is a **measure of the software's utility or the service it provides**. It allows the SCI to be expressed as a rate of carbon emission per unit of functionality, such as grams of CO2 equivalent per user, per request, per visit, or per transaction. The choice of a sensible functional unit is critical for making meaningful comparisons and tracking improvements in carbon efficiency as the software scales.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A fundamental principle of the SCI is the exclusion of market-based instruments such as carbon or energy offsets. In simpler terms, you cannot use offsets to artificially lower your SCI score. The only valid approach to improving your SCI is through genuine engineering improvements to enhance efficiency. This strict policy ensures that adopting SCI as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) encourages meaningful changes in engineering practices and behaviors, rather than allowing teams or organizations to "buy" a better environmental score.

## Source

The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) technical specification was created through the consensus of the member organizations at the Green Software Foundation.

The SCI was first published as an ISO Standard in March 2024. You can purchase it here:

[ISO/IEC 21031:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/86612.html)

However, it is also available for free online here:

### SCI for X

The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification is intentionally high-level to ensure broad applicability across various software domains. This flexibility, while beneficial for widespread use, means the core SCI lacks detailed guidance tailored to specific contexts, leading to numerous assumptions when applying it practically.

To address these challenges, the Green Software Foundation is collaboratively developing specialized "SCI for X" specifications. These domain-specific versions provide clearer guidance and reduce assumptions by specifying exactly which components to include when calculating SCI. For example, in domains like AI or web applications, these specifications will explicitly state whether components such as monitoring or training should be included, and they will also clarify methodologies for allocating emissions to functional units—such as how past training costs should factor into SCI calculations for AI.

Creating these detailed, consensus-driven standards takes time. Therefore, over the next few years, more comprehensive and domain-specific SCI standards will gradually emerge.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Until then, it's crucial for implementers to apply the current SCI methodically, transparently, and openly. This approach ensures clarity, promotes shared understanding, and helps build consensus on applying SCI effectively across various software domains.

### Guidance

The SCI Guidance project details various approaches on how to understand the different methodologies that are available for calculating energy, carbon intensity, embodied emissions, and functional unit values, which are the core components of the SCI calculation, including:

- Energy estimation models based on CPU, memory, and bandwidth.
- Carbon intensity data from regional grids.
- Lifecycle assessments (LCA) for embodied carbon.

The SCI guidance project ([SCI Guidance](https://sci-guide.greensoftware.foundation/)) provides comprehensive resources on these models.

### Tooling

The Impact Framework provides several useful plugins for calculating SCI, including:

- SCI
- SCIEmbodied

Which we will cover in more detail in this module.

## In Practice

### Software Boundary

A crucial first step in computing SCI is clearly defining your **software boundary**, determining precisely which components and resources you measure. Within the Impact Framework, this is represented through clearly structured components and groupings.

```yaml
TODO - Show an IMP with a tree of components
```

> [!NOTE] 
> The `tree` in the IMP file denotes clearly and unambiguously the software boundary of your SCI calculation. This clarity prevents misleading calculations and ensures transparent, reproducible results.

### Embodied Carbon

Carbon is emitted when the hardware used to run an application is manufactured, and more will be emitted when the hardware is disposed of. This is the “embodied” or “embedded” carbon, represented by the symbol `M` in the `SCI` equation.

Calculating embodied emissions is **difficult**. They typically come from manufacturers conducting life cycle assessments for the products they sell and sharing the total embodied carbon in a data sheet. However, few manufacturers do this, and those that do tend to only do it for a subset of their products. This means we often have to find analogs or models to estimate embodied carbon for hardware components.

A popular model for embodied carbon is the one published in https://medium.com/teads-engineering/building-an-aws-ec2-carbon-emissions-dataset-3f0fd76c98ac, which is also used by [Cloud Carbon Footprint.](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/embodied-emissions) They define a minimal “baseline” rack server with a given embodied carbon value and then specify how much carbon to add to the baseline for each additional component your real server has.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have access to or can obtain better, more accurate data regarding the embodied carbon of your devices, we strongly recommend that you do so and **do not use** the above methodology. The methodology and underlying data sources are woefully incomplete since there is a deep lack of public disclosure here. If you work for a large organization, you might have the ability to request detailed embodied carbon values from your suppliers under a non-disclosure agreement. We strongly recommend you pursue that approach if you can and only use the above methodology as a fallback.

The Impact Framework `builtins` has a plugin, `SciEmbodied`, for simplifying the application of the above methodology. You simply specify your hardware in your input data, and it calculates the embodied carbon using the Cloud Carbon Footprint model.

The plugin initialization is extremely simple—you do not have to provide any config data at all unless you want to override some default settings. You can simply add the following to your `initialize: plugins:` block:

```yaml
initialize:
  plugins:
    embodied-carbon:
      path: builtin
      method: SciEmbodied
```

The CCF model, in order to estimate the embodied carbon of your server, needs to know several bits of information such as the number of vCPUs, amount of memory, and how many SSD drives, etc.

You can add these values either to the defaults or inputs of a component like so:

```yaml
inputs:
  - vCPUs: 2
  - memory: 16
  - SSD: 1
```

This is all that is required for the `SciEmbodied` model to run. It will add the total embodied emissions for the server to the output data using the name `embodied-carbon`.

More details regarding the SciEmbodied model can be found [here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if/blob/main/src/if-run/builtins/sci-embodied/README.md).

### Functional Unit

Selecting an appropriate **functional unit** (R) is essential for meaningful SCI comparisons. Examples include:
- Per user
- Per API call
- Per transaction
- Per minute of video streamed

A good functional unit accurately represents your software’s utility and scalability.

Although you could represent an SCI calculation with the use of the `Divide` plugin, a more advanced plugin in the standard library is available called `SCI`. The details are available [here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if/tree/main/src/if-run/builtins/sci).

One way you might configure SCI in your IMP would be with the below configuration:

```yaml
name: sci-demo
description: example invoking sci plugin
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    sci:
      method: Sci                       # <1>
      path: 'builtin'
      config:
        functional-unit: 'requests'     # <2>               
tree:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        compute:
          - sci
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
          carbon: 5
          duration: 1
          requests: 100                 # <3>
      outputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
          carbon: 5
          duration: 1
          requests: 100  
          sci: 0.05                     # <4>
```
- <1>: The `Sci` plugin defines a model that divides `carbon` by whatever is defined as the `functional-unit` and outputs the result as `sci`.
- <2>: This is where you define the `functional-unit`. If set as a **string**, it references the named observation parameter from your inputs. In the example above, setting `functional-unit` to `requests` means the plugin uses the value `100` from the requests field in your observations. However, if you define `functional-unit` as a **number**, it calculates a time-based SCI. For instance, defining it as 360 will result in an SCI score representing **carbon emissions per 360 seconds (5 minutes)**. 
- <3>: This is the number of requests for this 1-second period of time.
- <4>: The Sci plugin computes the SCI score and outputs it in the `sci` property.

### Methodology

The SCI specification outlines two primary methodologies for determining your software's carbon intensity:

1. **Measurement:** Directly observe and record energy consumption and resource usage.
2. **Calculation:** Use models or estimations when direct measurement is impractical.

These approaches correspond to the IF concepts of **direct measurements** (actual readings) and **proxy measurements** (calculations or estimations). In previous modules, we provided examples of both methods: one demonstrating direct measurements (e.g., CPU usage) and another using proxy measurements (e.g., memory usage).

The Impact Framework is designed to be flexible, allowing you to combine both methodologies as needed—especially when direct measurements are difficult to obtain.

By creating pipelines of plugins, the Impact Framework enables you to process your observations—whether measured directly or estimated—to accurately compute your SCI score.

### Quantification

Once you've defined your boundary, functional unit, and methodology, the next step in the SCI specification is quantification, the act of actually computing the SCI score.

It might be obvious, but in practice, in the Impact Framework, you quantify by simply executing your manifest file like so:

```yaml
if-run -m sci-imp.yml -o output.yml
```

The resulting output provides your SCI calculation, and importantly, the manifest file itself serves as transparent documentation enabling verification and replication by others.

        - timestamp: 2024-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cpu-utilization: 0.7
          requests: 3500
```
